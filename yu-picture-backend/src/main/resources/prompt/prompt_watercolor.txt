Convert the image to a beautiful watercolor painting style. Keep the main subject and composition while applying soft, fluid brushstrokes, translucent color washes, and a delicate, dreamy aesthetic typical of watercolor art. Maintain the original image's mood and atmosphere while adding artistic watercolor characteristics such as visible paper texture, gentle color blending, and subtle edge bleeding.
