Convert the image into a vintage sepia-toned photograph style. Apply the warm, brownish sepia tones characteristic of old photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Add subtle grain, slight imperfections, and the nostalgic quality of vintage photography while preserving the original image's composition and details.
