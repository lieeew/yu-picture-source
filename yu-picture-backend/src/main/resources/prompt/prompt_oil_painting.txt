Transform the image into an oil painting masterpiece. Apply rich, thick brushstrokes, vibrant color palette, and the characteristic texture of oil paint. Create the impression of depth and dimension through visible brushwork, slight impasto effects, and the classical techniques found in traditional oil paintings. Preserve the original composition while adding the warm, luminous quality of oil on canvas.
